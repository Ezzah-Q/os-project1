# Dev Log â€“ CS4348 Project 1

10-01-2025, 10:26 pm

- created the project local repo and connected it to GitHub
- added the java files (logger, driver, encrypter, readme, and devlog)
- looked at project description, thoughts for now...
  - seems like I should start on some psuedocode first
  - focus on logger file as that seems the easiest
  - so logger needs the log file as input from driver, since it write to it
  - seems like the [action] part of a line is coming from the driver
  - we also need DateTime format but thats just use of library
  - also need classes for file reading and writing (FileWriter, BufferedReader)
  - Driver communicating with encryption and logger through standard input/output
  - will start on pseudocode maybe coding in next working session
